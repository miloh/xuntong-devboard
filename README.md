Xuntong Devboard(s)
-------------------
The ptr-9018 module by itself is difficult to interface with projects. PTH and SMT adapter
boards make it easier to integrate the module into projects or products 

###SMT adapter
A single 2-4 layer pcb including pads for a xuntong module, passive components,
swd programming port, and power via 2 pin jumper or a 20mm coin cell mount on
the board bottom

###PTH adapter
'Plated through holes'
same as the above, but modified for prototyping or project use with 100thou
pitch plated through holes intended for use on an old school breadboard
